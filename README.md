# Prediction-of-loan-eligibility-using-Machine-Learning.
# Introduction
In the banking industries the loans are the most important element of every banks. The main profit for the bank comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have idea that the applicant will be able to repay the loan with no difficulties.

# Objective
The main objective of the model to predict if an applicant is able to repay the loan to the lending company or not by analysing the factors which is given in the dataset. In this project we have been made a classification model for loan prediction.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in our project is gathered from the Kaggle.com which is a very useful site for finding different dataset for testing our skills in the Data Science and Machine Learning. Kaggle has dataset of different type from 1 MB to 100 GB.

# Methodology
Data Collection, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualisation & Machine Learning Model.

# Machine Learning techniques used
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree & Random Forest

# Conclusion
By using the different factors in the dataset and by the machine learinig techniques we can predict the loan eligibility.
